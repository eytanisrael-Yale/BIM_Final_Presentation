Robots are increasingly present in social and group settings, from
photo assistants to event helpers. In many cases, the usefulness
and acceptance of a robot in a group social setting depends on
how natural and trustworthy the robot is. Thus, it is essential
to create interactions that feel natural and intuitive with a robot
to build trust between the robot and the subjects interacting with
it. This will allow the robot to be more useful and accepted in
real-world group tasks.

One way to create more natural interactions in group settings is
to personalize the instructions and the way a robot addresses a given
person in a group of people. If the robot is able to uniquely address
each person in the group, as a human would, the interaction might
become more natural and intuitive, leading to greater acceptance
and use of the robot. By focusing on distinguishing details about
a person when addressing them, such as their appearance and
relative position in a group of people, our robot will be able to
call out specific individuals in a larger group and personalize its
interactions.
